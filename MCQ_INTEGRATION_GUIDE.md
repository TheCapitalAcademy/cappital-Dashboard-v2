### 6. Best Practices

#### MCQ Selection

2. **Mix Question Types**: Include different difficulty levels
3. **Subject Coverage**: Ensure all test subjects are represented
4. **Review Questions**: Check selected MCQs before saving

#### Performance Tips
1. **Use Filters**: Apply filters to reduce the number of MCQs to browse
2. **Search Efficiently**: Use specific keywords in search
3. **Bulk Operations**: Use select all/deselect all for large selections
4. **Save Regularly**: Save tests frequently to avoid losing work

### 7. Troubleshooting
